	<string name="about_dialog">This app was developed through the E-Rthyms Project. E-Rhythms are the Everyday and Eclectic Rhythms of Electronically mediated social interaction. They are the patterns of phone calls, text messages, social media posts, and emails that connect friends, family, and colleagues. They are the fabric of contemporary social life, they help us get by and get ahead, and their complexity necessitates the development of new studies and software.
